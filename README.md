# PythonLearnTutorials1
 This repository is part 1 of the Python Tutorials. I took the code and ran it in Jupyter Notebook. Then I saved it as a ipnyb file and uploaded here in Github. This repository has the code for hello, variables, lists, basic operators, string formatting and basic string conditions.
